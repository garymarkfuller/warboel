# Magic system ideas and notes

## Ideas

- Magic exists in the animals and plants of the land. Soaking specific woods in the blood of certain animals can generate artifacts that confer powers when touching the skin. This has resulted in the use of wooden jewellery and armour by warriors to increase their strength, speed, and agility. It also means that wands are commonly used by magic users.  

## Notes

- Magical travel between the two planets is only possible once every 640 days when they are in perfect alignment.
