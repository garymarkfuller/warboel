# Magic system

- Magic exists in the animals and plants of the land and is channeled through wood.
- By soaking specific woods in the blood of certain animals or the fruits of certain plants magic users can generate artifacts that confer powers when touching the skin.
- Magically enhanced wooden jewellery and armour is used by warriors to increase their strength, speed, and agility.
- Wands and staffs are commonly used by magic users as the physical manifestations of magic must be channeled via treated wooden objects.
- Only evil magic users use the blood of sentient beings.
- Good magic users often use fruits rather than animal blood.
- Magic users are those who can create wooden magical artifacts and cause external physical manifestations using them.
- Magic use therefore requires both sensitivity to magic and ability at carpentry.
- Magic users are often therefore referred to as master carpenters. 
- Anyone can benefit from the enhancements conferred by being in contact with a magical artiact.
- Magical travel between the two planets is possible once every 640 days when they are in perfect alignment.
