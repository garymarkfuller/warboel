# Planets

- The setting contains two habitable planets in a resonant orbit around an Orange Dwarf (K-Type) star with a diameter of approximately 1,200,000km. 
- Each is around 60,000km in circumference (1.5 times that of Earth). 
- They are around 120,000,000km apart at the closest point of their orbits, which occur once every 640 days. 
- The planets have a mass of between two and two-and-a-half times that of Earth, rotating every 24 hours and experiencing approximately 1g gravity.
- The average surface temperature of Earth is approximately 15 degrees celsius. 

## Planet 1

- Is approximately 75,000,000km away from its star.
- Orbits its star in roughly 160 days, with seasons lasting 40 days.
- This planet has an average surface temperature of around 20 degrees celsius.
- This planet has a larger percentage of water than the other planet and experiences more temperature and weather variation.
- Denizens of this planet are slender, with longer limbs and darker skin, and have superior daytime vision.

## Planet 2

- Is approximately 195,000,000km away from its star.
- Orbits its star in roughly 640 days, with seasons lasting 160 days.
- This planet has an average surface temperature of around 10 degrees celsius.
- Denizens of this planet are short and stocky, with lots of hair, and have superior nighttime vision.
