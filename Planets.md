# Planets

- The setting contains two habitable planets in a resonant orbit around an Orange Dwarf (K-Type) star. 
- Each is around 60,000km in circumference (1.5 times that of Earth). 
- They are around 120,000,000km apart at the closest point of their orbits, which occur once every 640 days. 
- The planets have a mass of between two and two-and-a-half times that of Earth, rotating every 24 hours and experiencing approximately 1g gravity.

## Planet 1

- Is approximately 75,000,000km away from its star.
- Orbits its star in roughly 160 days, with seasons lasting 40 days.

## Planet 2

- Is approximately 195,000,000km away from its star.
- Orbits its star in roughly 640 days, with seasons lasting 160 days.
